/// What the mascot's face says.
///
/// A mood is a reading of the app's state, not a decoration. Each one is
/// spent on one thing, so that a face means the same everywhere it appears:
///
/// * [happy] — the ordinary good state. The default.
/// * [delighted] — something finished and went well: a sync that landed, a
///   charge that reached its target.
/// * [surprised] — a reading the reader is unlikely to expect, and that is
///   not a fault.
/// * [sad] — an action failed and nothing was lost by it.
/// * [angry] — a fault the reader has to act on.
/// * [worried] — a degraded state: a stale reading, a car that stopped
///   answering, an estimate standing in for a measurement.
/// * [sleeping] — nothing is running, and nothing is wrong. An idle sync, a
///   parked car.
/// * [winking] — an aside: a hint, a tip, a small confirmation.
/// * [determined] — work is in flight.
///
/// A mood must never be the only carrier of a state. It sits beside the words
/// and the number that state it; a reader who does not read faces has to lose
/// nothing.
